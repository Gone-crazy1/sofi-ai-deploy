# Sofi AI Transfer Flow Improvements

## Overview of Changes
This update improves the Sofi AI money transfer flow to provide a cleaner, more professional user experience:

1. **Clean Account Verification**:
   - Silently verifies account in the background
   - Shows "‚úÖ Account Verified" with the real account holder name
   - No more "Verifying recipient account..." messages

2. **Professional Transfer Confirmation**:
   - Shows properly formatted details: name, account, bank
   - Clean, concise message format matching your requirements
   - No mention of "Xara" anywhere

3. **Secure PIN Entry**:
   - Replaced PIN keyboard with "üîê Enter My PIN" button
   - PIN entered only after clicking the button for better security
   - Better error handling for PIN status

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
- **main.py**: Core bot logic updated with new messaging flow
- **debug_pin_errors.py**: Script that fixes PIN handling errors
- **implement_clean_transfer_flow.py**: Script that implements the clean transfer confirmation
- **ensure_pin_button.py**: Script that ensures PIN entry uses a button instead of a keyboard

### Key Changes:

1. **Account Verification Message**:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Account Verified: [REAL_NAME]
   
   You're about to send ‚Ç¶5,025 to:
   üè¶ [REAL_NAME] ‚Äî [ACCOUNT_NUMBER] ([BANK_NAME])
   
   üëâ Please click the button below to enter your 4-digit transaction PIN securely:
   [üîê Enter My PIN]
   ```

2. **PIN Entry Flow**:
   - User sees "Enter My PIN" button
   - When clicked, shows PIN entry keyboard
   - After PIN entry, sends confirmation and receipt

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Fixed `result["status"]` error by using `result.get("status")`
   - Better error reporting for PIN entry failures
   - Clearer user feedback throughout the process

## Testing
Use the included test script (`test_improved_flow.py`) to verify the changes:
1. Run `python test_improved_flow.py`
2. Check the Telegram bot responses match the expected format
3. Verify the PIN entry button works correctly

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
1. Check logs for any remaining "status" key errors
2. Verify PIN session is properly initialized
3. Ensure all "Xara" mentions have been removed
4. Run `python debug_pin_errors.py` again if needed

## Deployment
To deploy these changes:
1. Make sure all scripts have been run
2. Restart the bot with `python main.py`
3. Test with a real transfer command on Telegram
4. Verify logs show no PIN status errors
