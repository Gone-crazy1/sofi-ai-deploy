🔐 SECURE TRANSFER INTEGRATION PATCH

This patch integrates secure balance checking and PIN verification into the main transfer flow.
Use this to fix the security gaps in the transfer system.

🔐 MANUAL INTEGRATION GUIDE - SECURE TRANSFER SYSTEM
===================================================

PROBLEM SOLVED:
❌ Users could send more money than they have
❌ Hardcoded PIN "1234" for all users  
❌ No account lockout protection
❌ No transaction limits

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
✅ Comprehensive balance checking
✅ User-specific PIN verification
✅ Account lockout after 3 failed attempts
✅ Transaction limits and validation
✅ Secure error handling

FILES CREATED:
1. utils/permanent_memory.py - Secure PIN verification and balance checking
2. utils/secure_transfer_handler.py - Secure transfer flow handler
3. utils/balance_helper.py - Balance checking utilities
4. secure_transaction_schema.sql - Database schema for security

INTEGRATION STEPS:

Step 1: Deploy Database Schema
------------------------------
Run the SQL commands in secure_transaction_schema.sql in your Supabase SQL editor:
- Creates pin_attempts table
- Creates daily_transaction_limits table  
- Creates security_audit_log table
- Adds balance column to virtual_accounts
- Sets up Row Level Security

Step 2: Update main.py Imports
------------------------------
Add these imports at the top of main.py:

from utils.secure_transfer_handler import handle_secure_transfer_confirmation
from utils.balance_helper import get_user_balance, check_virtual_account

Step 3: Replace Transfer Confirmation Logic
-------------------------------------------
Find the section with "elif current_step == 'confirm_transfer':" in main.py
Replace the entire section with:

elif current_step == 'confirm_transfer':
    # Use secure transfer handler with comprehensive security checks
    response = await handle_secure_transfer_confirmation(
        chat_id=chat_id,
        message=message,
        user_data=user_data,
        transfer_data=state['transfer']
    )
    return response

SECURITY FEATURES:
1. ✅ Balance Check: Users cannot send more than they have
2. ✅ PIN Security: Each user has their own secure PIN (from onboarding)
3. ✅ Account Lockout: 3 failed PIN attempts = 15 minute lockout
4. ✅ Transaction Limits: Max ₦500k per transaction, max 20 transactions per day
5. ✅ Fees Included: Balance check includes transaction fees
6. ✅ Error Handling: Graceful handling of all error conditions
7. ✅ Audit Trail: All transactions logged for compliance

TEST THE SYSTEM:
1. Deploy the schema to Supabase
2. Update main.py with the new imports and transfer logic
3. Test with a user who has insufficient balance
4. Test with wrong PIN (should lock after 3 attempts)
5. Test with correct PIN and sufficient balance

RESULT:
Users can no longer:
❌ Send more money than they have
❌ Use hardcoded PINs  
❌ Bypass security checks
❌ Go into negative balance

Users now get:
✅ Professional insufficient balance messages
✅ Funding options when balance is low
✅ Secure PIN verification
✅ Account protection
✅ Beautiful receipts for successful transfers
