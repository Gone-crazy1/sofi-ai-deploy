Paystack Integration Strategy for Sofi AI
==========================================

PHASE 1: Quick Paystack Integration (1-2 days)
- Add Paystack virtual account creation
- Update transfer logic to use Paystack
- Test with small amounts
- Validate OpenAI Assistant function calls

PHASE 2: Dual Provider Setup (3-5 days)  
- Create payment provider abstraction layer
- Support both Paystack and Monnify
- Auto-fallback between providers
- User can choose preferred provider

PHASE 3: Cost Optimization (Ongoing)
- Monitor transaction volumes and fees
- Switch users to cheaper provider when available
- Negotiate better rates based on volume

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
1. Get Paystack working FIRST (validate AI Assistant)
2. Keep Monnify code ready for when they approve
3. Build abstraction layer for easy switching

COST ANALYSIS:
- Paystack fees: ~1.5% + ₦100 for transfers
- Monnify fees: ~0.5% (estimated, no deposit charges)
- Break-even: ~₦10,000 transaction volume daily

BUSINESS LOGIC:
- Start with Paystack for validation
- Move high-value customers to Monnify when available
- Keep small transactions on whichever is cheaper
