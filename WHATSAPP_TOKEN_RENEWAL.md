## 🚀 WhatsApp Production Setup - Token Renewal Required

### ⚠️ Issue: Access Token Expired

Your WhatsApp access token has expired (tokens typically last 24 hours). Here's how to fix it:

### 🔧 Quick Fix - Get New Token

**Option 1: Temporary Token (24 hours)**
1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps
2. Select your WhatsApp Business app
3. Navigate to: WhatsApp → API Setup
4. Click "Generate access token"
5. Copy the new token

**Option 2: Permanent Token (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://business.facebook.com/settings/system-users
2. Create new system user: "Sofi AI"
3. Generate token with `whatsapp_business_messaging` permission
4. Use this permanent token

### 📝 Update .env File

Replace the current `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your new token:

```env
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_NEW_TOKEN_HERE
```

### ✅ Current Configuration (Working)

- Phone Number ID: `791159074061207` ✅
- Business Account ID: `683628188046191` ✅  
- Webhook endpoint: `/whatsapp-webhook` ✅
- Message handlers: Implemented ✅

### 🧪 Test After Update

Run: `python test_whatsapp_production.py`

### 🎉 Features Ready

Once token is updated, Sofi can:
- Receive WhatsApp messages
- Send automated responses  
- Handle balance checks
- Guide user signup
- Process financial queries

**The integration is complete - just needs a fresh token!**
