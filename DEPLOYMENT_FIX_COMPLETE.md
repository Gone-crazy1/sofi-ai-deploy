# ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT FIX COMPLETE - Import Errors Resolved

## âœ… ISSUE FIXED

### **Problem Identified**
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'beneficiary_service' from 'utils.supabase_beneficiary_service'
```

### **Root Cause**
- Legacy beneficiary handler was trying to import a global `beneficiary_service` instance
- The instance was removed to avoid initialization issues
- This caused deployment failure on Render

### **Solution Applied**
1. âœ… **Added Global Instance with Error Handling**
   ```python
   try:
       beneficiary_service = SupabaseBeneficiaryService()
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Warning: Could not initialize beneficiary_service: {e}")
       beneficiary_service = None
   ```

2. âœ… **Updated Legacy Handler**
   - Changed to import `SupabaseBeneficiaryService` class
   - Create service instances within the handler class
   - Added missing `_format_beneficiaries_list` method

3. âœ… **Enhanced Helper Functions**
   - Added fallback logic for when global instance is None
   - Graceful degradation for missing environment variables

## ðŸ”§ FILES FIXED

### **utils/supabase_beneficiary_service.py**
- âœ… Added global `beneficiary_service` instance with error handling
- âœ… Updated helper functions with fallback logic
- âœ… Maintains backward compatibility

### **utils/legacy_beneficiary_handler.py**
- âœ… Fixed import to use class instead of instance
- âœ… Added `_format_beneficiaries_list` method
- âœ… Updated all service calls to use `self.beneficiary_service`
