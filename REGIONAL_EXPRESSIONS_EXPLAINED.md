üá≥üá¨ REGIONAL EXPRESSIONS DATABASE EXPLAINED
===========================================

WHAT IS IT?
===========
A "Regional Expressions Database" is like a Nigerian dictionary that helps Sofi 
understand how real Nigerians speak about money and banking, instead of just 
formal English.

CURRENT PROBLEM
===============
Right now, Sofi might struggle with:
‚ùå "Abeg send 5k give my guy" 
‚ùå "My account don empty"
‚ùå "I wan buy credit sharp sharp"
‚ùå "Wetin dey my wallet?"

WITH REGIONAL DATABASE
=====================
Sofi would understand:
‚úÖ "Abeg send 5k give my guy" = "Please send ‚Ç¶5,000 to my friend"
‚úÖ "My account don empty" = "My account is empty" 
‚úÖ "I wan buy credit sharp sharp" = "I want to buy airtime quickly"
‚úÖ "Wetin dey my wallet?" = "What's in my account?"

EXAMPLES OF EXPRESSIONS
=======================

MONEY TERMS:
‚Ä¢ "kudi" = money (Hausa)
‚Ä¢ "ego" = money (Igbo) 
‚Ä¢ "owo" = money (Yoruba)
‚Ä¢ "5k" = ‚Ç¶5,000
‚Ä¢ "50k" = ‚Ç¶50,000

TRANSFER TERMS:
‚Ä¢ "send am" = send it
‚Ä¢ "send give" = send to
‚Ä¢ "transfer give" = transfer to
‚Ä¢ "credit am" = send money to them
‚Ä¢ "settle am" = pay them

URGENCY TERMS:
‚Ä¢ "sharp sharp" = quickly/immediately
‚Ä¢ "now now" = right now
‚Ä¢ "make e fast" = make it fast
‚Ä¢ "urgent" = urgent

PERSON TERMS:
‚Ä¢ "my guy" = my friend
‚Ä¢ "my padi" = my friend
‚Ä¢ "my person" = my friend
‚Ä¢ "my mama" = my mother
‚Ä¢ "my papa" = my father

BALANCE TERMS:
‚Ä¢ "wetin dey my account" = what's in my account
‚Ä¢ "how much I get" = how much do I have
‚Ä¢ "my wallet" = my account
‚Ä¢ "account don empty" = account is empty

REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES
==================

BEFORE (Without Regional Database):
User: "Abeg send 10k give my mama for village sharp sharp"
Sofi: "I'm not sure what you mean. Can you rephrase?"

AFTER (With Regional Database):
User: "Abeg send 10k give my mama for village sharp sharp"  
Sofi: "I understand you need to urgently send ‚Ç¶10,000 to your mother. 
      Let me help you with that right away!"

BENEFITS FOR YOUR USERS
=======================
‚úÖ Sofi speaks their language
‚úÖ No more "I don't understand" responses
‚úÖ More inclusive for all Nigerians
‚úÖ Faster transactions (no need to rephrase)
‚úÖ Cultural sensitivity 
‚úÖ Support for multiple Nigerian languages
‚úÖ Better user experience
‚úÖ Reduced frustration

HOW IT WOULD WORK
=================
1. User sends: "Abeg send 5k give my guy"
2. Sofi translates: "Please send ‚Ç¶5,000 to my friend"
3. Sofi processes the standard English version
4. Sofi responds naturally: "Sure! I can help you send ‚Ç¶5,000 to your friend"

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
=======================
‚Ä¢ Database of Nigerian expressions
‚Ä¢ Translation layer before intent detection
‚Ä¢ Enhanced AI prompts with cultural context
‚Ä¢ Support for Pidgin, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa phrases
‚Ä¢ Context understanding (urgent, family, business)

CURRENT STATUS
==============
Your Sofi AI already has good OpenAI integration, but adding this regional
database would make it truly Nigerian-friendly and accessible to all users,
regardless of their English proficiency or preferred way of speaking.

RECOMMENDATION
==============
This enhancement would significantly improve user experience for Nigerian users
and make Sofi feel more like a local friend than a foreign bot.
