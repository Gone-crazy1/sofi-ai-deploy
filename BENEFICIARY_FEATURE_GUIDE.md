# Save Beneficiaries Feature - Complete Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview
The Save Beneficiaries feature allows Sofi AI users to save recipients after successful transfers for faster future transactions. The system is fully integrated with the OpenAI Assistant and uses Supabase for data storage.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema (Supabase)
```sql
CREATE TABLE beneficiaries (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL, -- Nickname (e.g., "Mum", "John")
  bank_name TEXT NOT NULL, -- Bank name (e.g., "Opay", "GTBank")
  account_number TEXT NOT NULL, -- Account number
  account_holder_name TEXT NOT NULL, -- Real account holder name
  account_type TEXT DEFAULT 'bank', -- Type: bank, wallet, crypto
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Key Components

1. **SofiBeneficiaryService** (`utils/supabase_beneficiary_service.py`)
   - Main service for all beneficiary operations
   - Handles save, retrieve, find, and delete operations
   - Integrates with Supabase database

2. **OpenAI Assistant Functions** (`sofi_assistant_functions.py`)
   - `get_user_beneficiaries()` - List saved contacts
   - `save_beneficiary()` - Save new recipient
   - `find_beneficiary_by_name()` - Find saved contact by nickname

3. **Legacy Handler** (`utils/legacy_beneficiary_handler.py`)
   - Backward compatibility for existing bot commands
   - Bridges old system to new Supabase integration

## 🔄 User Flow

### 1. After Successful Transfer
```
Transfer: ₦5,000 to THANKGOD OLUWASEUN NDIDI (8104965538 - Opay)
✅ Transfer completed! Reference: SF123456789

👉 Would you like to save THANKGOD OLUWASEUN NDIDI - Opay - 8104965538 
   as a beneficiary for future transfers?

💡 This will let you send money to them instantly just by saying their name!
Reply "yes" or "save" to add them to your saved recipients.
```

### 2. User Response Options
- **"yes"** or **"save"** → Saves with first name as nickname
- **"save as Mum"** → Saves with custom nickname "Mum"
- **"no"** → Skips saving
- **"John"** → Treats as custom nickname

### 3. Future Quick Transfers
```
User: "Send 2000 to John"
Assistant: Found John: THANKGOD OLUWASEUN NDIDI - Opay - 8104965538
          Sending ₦2,000...
```

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
cat create_beneficiaries_table_new.sql | supabase db sql
```

### Step 2: Assistant Integration
The assistant automatically:
- Detects names in transfer requests
- Searches beneficiaries first
- Prompts to save after successful transfers
- Handles natural language beneficiary interactions

### Step 3: Testing
```bash
python test_beneficiary_integration.py
```

## 📋 API Reference

### SofiBeneficiaryService Methods

#### `save_beneficiary(user_id, name, bank_name, account_number, account_holder_name)`
```python
result = await beneficiary_service.save_beneficiary(
    user_id="uuid-here",
    name="Mum",
    bank_name="GTBank",
    account_number="0123456789",
    account_holder_name="MARY JOHNSON"
)
# Returns: {"success": True, "message": "✅ MARY JOHNSON saved as 'Mum'!"}
```

#### `find_beneficiary_by_name(user_id, name)`
```python
beneficiary = await beneficiary_service.find_beneficiary_by_name(
    user_id="uuid-here",
    name="john"
)
# Returns: Dict with beneficiary data or None
```

#### `get_user_beneficiaries(user_id)`
```python
beneficiaries = await beneficiary_service.get_user_beneficiaries("uuid-here")
# Returns: List of beneficiary dictionaries
```

### OpenAI Assistant Functions

#### Function: `find_beneficiary_by_name`
**Purpose**: Find saved contact by nickname
**Parameters**: `name` (string)
**Usage**: When user says "send to John" or "pay my wife"

#### Function: `save_beneficiary`
**Purpose**: Save recipient as beneficiary
**Parameters**: `name`, `bank_name`, `account_number`, `account_holder_name`
**Usage**: After user confirms saving a recipient

#### Function: `get_user_beneficiaries`
**Purpose**: List all saved contacts
**Parameters**: None
**Usage**: When user asks "show my contacts" or "list beneficiaries"

## 🛡️ Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Users can only access their own beneficiaries
   - Automatic user_id filtering

2. **Duplicate Prevention**
   - Unique constraint on user_id + account_number
   - Prevents saving same account twice

3. **Data Validation**
   - Required fields enforced
   - Account number format validation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

### Database Policies
```sql
-- Auto-generated RLS policies ensure users only see their data
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own beneficiaries" ON beneficiaries
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Saving After Transfer
```
Assistant: "✅ Transfer completed! 
👉 Would you like to save JOHN SMITH - Access Bank - 0123456789 
as a beneficiary for future transfers?"

User: "yes"
Assistant: "✅ JOHN SMITH saved as 'JOHN' for future transfers!"
```

### Quick Transfer with Beneficiary
```
User: "send 5000 to john"
Assistant: "Found John: JOHN SMITH - Access Bank - 0123456789
🔐 Please use the secure link I sent to complete your ₦5,000 transfer."
```

### List Beneficiaries
```
User: "show my contacts"
Assistant: "💳 Your Saved Recipients

1. **Mum**
   MARY JOHNSON
   0123456789 • GTBank

2. **John**
   JOHN SMITH
   0987654321 • Access Bank

💡 Just type a recipient's name to start a transfer"
```

   - Check OpenAI Assistant function definitions
   - Verify function name spelling

### Debug Commands
```python
# Check user UUID
result = supabase.table("users").select("id").eq("telegram_chat_id", "123456").execute()

# List beneficiaries for user
beneficiaries = await beneficiary_service.get_user_beneficiaries("user-uuid-here")

# Test assistant function
result = await assistant._execute_function_background("get_user_beneficiaries", {}, "123456", None)
```
