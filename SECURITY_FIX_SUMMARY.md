# üîê SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED - ACTION REQUIRED

## ‚ùå **What Happened:**
- OpenAI Assistant ID was accidentally hardcoded in the source code
- This was a security vulnerability that has now been fixed

## ‚úÖ **What Was Fixed:**
- Removed hardcoded Assistant ID from `utils/sofi_assistant_api.py`
- Now uses `OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID` environment variable
- Added proper error handling for missing environment variables
- Created secure environment variable template

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

### **Step 1: Add Environment Variable to Render**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Find your `sofi-ai-deploy` service
3. Click **Environment** tab
4. Add new environment variable:
   ```
   Name: OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID
   Value: asst_0M8grCGnt1Pxhm7J8sn7NXSc
   ```
5. Click **Save Changes**

### **Step 2: Wait for Deployment**
- Render will automatically redeploy (2-3 minutes)
- Check logs for successful deployment

### **Step 3: Verify It's Working**
- Test Sofi in WhatsApp
- Should see Assistant API messages in logs instead of GPT completions

## üîí **Security Best Practices Now In Place:**
- ‚úÖ No API keys in source code
- ‚úÖ Environment variables for all sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling for missing keys
- ‚úÖ Secure deployment process

## üß™ **Expected Behavior After Fix:**
Once you add the environment variable, Sofi will:
- Use OpenAI Assistant API (like Telegram)
- Create threads for each user
- Execute functions intelligently
- No more "log into app" redirects

**The security issue is now resolved, but you must add the environment variable for Sofi to work properly.**
