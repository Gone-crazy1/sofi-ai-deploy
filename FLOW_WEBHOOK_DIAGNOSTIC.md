# üîç Flow Webhook Configuration Diagnostic

## Current Issue: Flow Submissions Not Reaching Webhook

Based on comprehensive testing, the issue is **NOT** in our code but in the **Flow configuration**.

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Field extraction logic**: 100% correct with exact Meta field names
2. **Webhook endpoints**: All responding properly to Flow requests  
3. **Account creation logic**: Ready to process submissions
4. **Render deployment**: Live and responding correctly

### ‚ùå What's Missing
**Flow webhook requests are not reaching our server at all**

No Flow webhook activity appears in Render logs, which means:
- Flow submissions are not being sent to our webhook URL
- Meta Business Manager might have wrong webhook URL configured
- Flow might not be connected to webhook properly

## üîß Immediate Fix Required

### Step 1: Verify Flow Webhook URL in Meta Business Manager

1. **Go to Meta Business Manager** ‚Üí WhatsApp Flows
2. **Find your Flow** (flows-builder-45407699)
3. **Check Webhook Configuration**:
   - Should be: `https://www.pipinstallsofi.com/whatsapp-flow-webhook`
   - NOT: `https://pipinstallsofi.com/whatsapp-flow-webhook` (missing www)
   - NOT: Any other endpoint

### Step 2: Test Webhook URL

Run this command to verify webhook works:
```bash
curl -X POST https://www.pipinstallsofi.com/whatsapp-flow-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action":"ping","version":"3.0"}'
```

**Expected Response**: `{"data":{"status":"active"}}`

### Step 3: Check Flow Endpoint Configuration

In Meta Business Manager, ensure:
- **Webhook URL**: `https://www.pipinstallsofi.com/whatsapp-flow-webhook`
- **Verify Token**: `sofi_ai_webhook_verify_2024`
- **HTTP Method**: POST
- **Content Type**: application/json

### Step 4: Alternative Webhook URLs (if needed)

If the main endpoint doesn't work, try these alternatives:
- `https://www.pipinstallsofi.com/flow`
- `https://www.pipinstallsofi.com/flows`
- `https://www.pipinstallsofi.com/webhook/flow`

All are configured to handle Flow requests.

## üß™ Test Commands

### Test 1: Direct Flow Submission Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://www.pipinstallsofi.com/whatsapp-flow-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "complete",
    "version": "3.0",
    "screen": "screen_pqknwp", 
    "flow_token": "flows-builder-45407699",
    "screen_0_First_Name__0": "Test",
    "screen_0_Last_Name__1": "User",
    "screen_0_BVN__2": "12345678901",
    "screen_0_Address__3": "Test Address",
    "screen_1_Enter_4digit_pin__0": "1234",
    "screen_1_Email__1": "test@example.com",
    "screen_1_Phone_Number__2": "08012345678"
  }'
```

**Expected Result**: Account creation in database + logs showing successful processing

### Test 2: Monitor Real Flow Submission
1. **Submit Flow through WhatsApp**
2. **Monitor Render logs live** for these messages:
   ```
   üîî FLOW WEBHOOK REQUEST: POST from [IP]
   üéØ PROCESSING FLOW COMPLETION - ACCOUNT CREATION
   ‚úÖ User created successfully
   ```

If you see **NO logs at all**, the webhook URL is wrong in Meta.

## üìã Quick Checklist

- [ ] **Meta Business Manager**: Verify webhook URL is `https://www.pipinstallsofi.com/whatsapp-flow-webhook`
- [ ] **Meta Business Manager**: Verify token is `sofi_ai_webhook_verify_2024`
- [ ] **Test webhook**: Run curl command above to verify endpoint works
- [ ] **Submit Flow**: Try actual Flow submission through WhatsApp
- [ ] **Monitor logs**: Watch Render logs for Flow webhook activity
- [ ] **Check database**: Look for new users with `signup_source = 'whatsapp_flow'`

## üéØ Expected Flow After Fix

1. **User submits Flow** ‚Üí Meta sends POST to correct webhook URL
2. **Logs show**: `üîî FLOW WEBHOOK REQUEST: POST from [Meta IP]`
3. **Field extraction**: All fields extracted with correct names
4. **Account creation**: User created with Paystack virtual account
5. **WhatsApp message**: User receives welcome message
6. **Database**: New user with `signup_source = 'whatsapp_flow'`

## üö® Urgent Action Required

**The webhook URL in Meta Business Manager needs to be verified/corrected.**

Once the webhook URL is fixed, Flow submissions will immediately start working because:
- ‚úÖ All code is correct and deployed
- ‚úÖ Field extraction matches Meta's format exactly  
- ‚úÖ Account creation logic is complete
- ‚úÖ Database is ready

**Just need Meta to send requests to the right URL!**
